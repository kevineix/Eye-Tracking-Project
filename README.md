By: Kevin Xie

Python Version 3.9.6

## Overview
When presented with graphs or any visual stimuli, individuals naturally focus on specific areas for varying durations. Utilizing eye tracking software allows the collection of data concerning these Areas of Interest (AOI), pinpointing where the eyes fixate and when these fixations occur.

By extracting and processing this data, further visualization and data analysis can be conducted. Eye tracking data is crucial in various fields, including psychology, user experience research, and human-computer interaction. 

This repository contains the code for extracting eye tracking data and processing the collected data sheets. It provides a streamlined process for extracting raw eye tracking data and generating processed data sheets for analysis.


## Features
- **Data Extraction**: The code includes scripts to extract eye tracking data from various eye tracking devices and formats. It supports common eye tracking file formats, ensuring compatibility with different systems.
- **Data Sheets**: The processed data sheets are generated in user-friendly formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) for easy integration into data analysis tools such as Python, R, or spreadsheet software.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided to guide users through the extraction and processing steps.
